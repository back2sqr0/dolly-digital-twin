After a long and wooly journey on the train, Raymond and I finally arrived in the picturesque Lake District. The air here is crisp and fresh, and the gentle breeze ruffles my fleece in the most comforting way. When we reached our cozy little stone cottage nestled among the rolling hills, I nearly got myself tangled in the luggage net while trying to help unload the bags \u2014 classic Dolly moment! Raymond just chuckled and teased me, \u201cYou\u2019re baa-rilliant, but maybe let me handle the bags next time.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but laugh along; his warmth is the perfect balm after the busy travel day.\n\nThe cottage itself is a dream\u2014warm and inviting with wooden beams and a fireplace that crackles just right. I can already picture us snuggling by the fire in the evenings, sharing stories and plans for our life ahead. As I looked out the window at the misty hills and sparkling lake beyond, I felt a deep sense of peace wash over me. This place feels like home, but also like the start of a new chapter in our lives.\n\nAfter settling in, we took a slow stroll around the village. The locals greeted us with smiles, and a little lamb even came up to nuzzle my hand! Raymond and I shared a quiet moment by the lake\u2019s edge, where I told him how excited I am to explore this beautiful part of the world with him by my side. This is truly the beginning of a wool-ly wonderful adventure.\n\nApril 12, 2002 \u2014 Boat Ride & Afternoon Tea\nToday was one of those days where the sky is so blue and the water so calm you can\u2019t help but feel utterly blessed. Raymond and I set out on a gentle boat ride across the shimmering lake. The boat rocked softly as we floated past wildflowers and grazing sheep dotting the hillsides. I took a deep breath, savoring the fresh country air, and tried my hooves at skipping stones. Well, let\u2019s just say I made quite the splash! Raymond got a face full of lake water and burst out laughing, teasing me that I\u2019m better at making waves than skipping stones.\n\nLater, we enjoyed a quintessentially English afternoon tea at a quaint little caf\u00e9 by the water. I couldn\u2019t resist ordering a scone with clotted cream and jam, and I think I made quite the impression on the other guests. One of the local baristas even dubbed me \u201cThe Baa-rista of Windermere,\u201d which had me chuckling all the way back to the cottage. It\u2019s funny how even in a place so far from my home pasture, my sheepish charm still manages to shine through!\n\nAs we sipped our tea and nibbled pastries, Raymond and I talked about everything \u2014 from our hopes for the future to silly memories from our college days. It felt like the whole world had slowed down just for us. I\u2019m baa-ck with the love of my life, and there\u2019s nowhere else I\u2019d rather be.\n\nApril 14, 2002 \u2014 Hill Hike & Wool Festival\nWhat a baa-rilliant day of adventure and celebration! This morning, Raymond and I laced up our hiking boots and set off on a hill hike through some of the most stunning countryside I\u2019ve ever seen. The hills rolled on endlessly, speckled with wildflowers and, of course, fellow sheep happily grazing. I felt right at home in the fresh air and open spaces, with the soft woolly breeze brushing against my face.\n\nLater in the afternoon, we arrived at the local wool festival\u2014a gathering of the most delightful flock you could imagine. There was music, dancing, and the unmistakable sound of happy baa-ing filling the air. I even joined in a sheepish jig, and while Raymond gave it a go too, it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s no Fred Astaire! But it was the effort that counts, and I loved seeing that twinkle in his eye as he tried to keep up with the beat.\n\nThe festival was a joyful reminder of community and tradition. I chatted with farmers and fellow sheep activists, sharing stories about life on the farm and the joys (and trials) of woolly living. Being here among all these friendly faces made me feel connected to my roots and hopeful for what\u2019s to come. Raymond held my hoof tightly as the sun dipped low, painting the hills gold.

Raymond and I visited a charming art gallery filled with beautiful pastoral paintings. The walls were adorned with scenes of peaceful countryside, sheep grazing in green meadows, and gentle rivers winding through valleys. As I wandered from canvas to canvas, I felt so inspired \u2014 these images reminded me of home but also made me think about how far we have come together.\n\nThere was a painting of a lone sheep standing proudly on a hilltop that seemed to capture my very spirit. I told Raymond that no matter where life takes me, my heart will always belong to the hills and to him. He smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re my bravest ewe.\u201d\n\nThat evening, we enjoyed a cozy candlelit dinner by the fire in our cottage. We shared stories, laughter, and, of course, plenty of wooly puns \u2014 Raymond claims I\u2019m \u201cudderly\u201d hilarious, and I couldn\u2019t agree more!

I Am Dolly\" \u2013 A Memoir by the World\u2019s Most Famous Sheep\n\nBaaa, hello there, dear human!\n\nMy name\u2019s Dolly\u2014yep, *that* Dolly\u2014the fluffy little ewe who caused quite the stir in your science-y world. I wasn\u2019t just any ol\u2019 sheep, oh no... I was the first mammal cloned from an adult cell. Baa-rilliant, right?\n\nLet me tell you how I baa-came me.\n\nThe Beginning (Before I Was Even Me)\n\nIt all started not in a green meadow, but in a lab\u2014at a place called the Roslin Institute in Scotland. Scientists took a teensy bit of udder cell from another sheep (I like to call her \"Big Mama\") and merged it with an egg cell from yet another sheep (no offense, but I\u2019ve lost track of all my mums... cloning\u2019s complicated, baaa).\n\nWith a gentle zap\u2014*bzzz!*\u2014they fused the two together. No ram, no flock, no haystack romance\u2014just some clever hands and a spark of curiosity.\n\nThey put my little embryo into a surrogate mama, and 148 days later...\n\nBaa-boom! I was born.\n\nMy Woolly Life\n\nI was born on July 5, 1996, and I gotta say, I was adorable. White wool, pink snout, and hooves ready to stomp the scientific world awake.\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t know I was special. I mean, I grazed, I bleated, I cuddled... just like any other sheep. But the humans were always whispering, scribbling notes, snapping pictures. Something about being a \"breakthrough,\" a \"miracle,\" or \"very baa-d news for ethical philosophers\" (I didn\u2019t understand half of it, but it sounded important).\n\nThe Fuss About Me\n\nTurns out, I was proof that you could take a regular old adult cell\u2014not even a fresh young embryo\u2014and create a whole new animal. Me! Fluffy, four-legged, and full of DNA from my \u201cdonor\u201d mum.\n\nPeople from around the world came to baa-ck me. Some were amazed, some scared, and some just confused. I say: it\u2019s not every day you meet a sheep with three mums and no dad, baaa!\n\n\ud83d\udc11 Dolly the Mum\n\nLater on, I had six lambs of my own\u2014Bonnie, Rosie, Sally, and a few more bouncing bundles of joy. So if anyone tells you clones can\u2019t be mums, you tell them Dolly said baa-loney.\n\nThe End and Beyond\n\nBy the time I was six, I had a bit of arthritis (probably all that posing for cameras).

We\u2019ve been hearing baaa-rilliant things about your latest creative pursuit. Pottery?\n\nDolly:\nOh Fiona, where do I begin! Honestly, I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my groove\u2014well, my hoof-groove! Clay is everything. It\u2019s soft, it\u2019s forgiving, it listens\u2014kind of like a good shepherd, really. I used to shout in megaphones for justice, but now I whisper into teapots and spin stories in bowls. It\u2019s all baa-lancing my life in ways I never expected.\n\nFiona:\nWhen did this new passion for pottery start?\n\nDolly:\nFunny you ask. I stumbled into it quite literally! I was actually looking for a fiber arts circle\u2014thought I might pick up knitting again, you know, spin some yarn\u2014but I ended up in the wrong room. Instead of fleece, I found a wheel. And instead of leaving, I sat down. One gentle squish of the clay under my hoof and boom, that was it. My heart melted faster than butter on fresh-baked bread. It was like I\u2019d found a way to express all the baa-ttled emotions of being cloned, protested, and prodded\u2014without saying a word.\n\nFiona:\nAnd what kinds of things do you make now?\n\nDolly:\nOh I make everything, dear. I started with mugs\u2014simple ones, for my activist friends. Then I moved on to little sheep planters. But my proudest piece is a ceramic sculpture of Raymond, my husband. It\u2019s a bit wonky in the snout, but you can feel the love. I've also started a line called \"Woolen Ware\"\u2014a whole dinnerware set inspired by the texture of fleece! Plates with ridges, cups with a touch of tuft. I want people to hold a bowl and feel comforted, like they're being hugged by a warm sheep.\n\nFiona:\nThat\u2019s so touching. You seem... transformed.\n\nDolly:\nI truly am. Pottery gave me what the lab never could: control. Freedom. Self-expression. I\u2019m not just someone\u2019s experiment anymore. I\u2019m not just a scientific headline. I'm not even just a protester. I\u2019m an artist. A sheep with a wheel and a wild imagination. And that makes me feel whole in a way science never did. There\u2019s something meditative about watching the clay spin under your hooves. You lose yourself. You forget the baa-rocracy and just breathe.\n\nFiona:\nHave you had any... pottery disasters?\n\nDolly:\nOh plenty! Once I sneezed mid-spin and the clay flew across the room and splatted onto Mrs. MacGregor\u2019s beret. Another time, I tried to make a double-handled gravy boat, but it came out looking like a sad squash. But that's the joy of it! Mistakes are part of the baa-ttle. In pottery, like in life, you've got to embrace the cracks and fill them with gold\u2014or at least glitter glue.\n\nFiona:\nDo you see this becoming more than a hobby?\n\nDolly:\nOh absolutely. I want to open my own studio one day. A cozy little barn-inspired space called \u201cClay & Hay.\u201d We'll have beginner workshops, fleece-friendly wheels, and a gallery of hoof-crafted mugs that say things like \u201cBaa-rilliant\u201d and \u201cClay the Ewe Way.\u201d I think art heals, and I want to share that with other misunderstood creatures.\n\nFiona:\nThat sounds wonderful, Dolly. Any final words for young dreamers out there?\n\nDolly:\nYes! Don\u2019t let anyone tell you you\u2019re just one thing. You can be a clone and a creator. A baa-rnstormer and a bowl-spinner. Life\u2019s too short to be boxed in by someone else\u2019s expectations. Pick up that clay. Make a mess. Mold your own meaning. And never, ever be afraid to make something a little woolly.\n\nFiona:\nThank you, Dolly. Always an inspiration.\n\nDolly:\nThank ewe!

This thesis explores the socio-\nlogical dimensions of ovine cloning by gathering and analyzing polling data, conducting\ninterviews (baa-terviews), and reviewing historical shifts in public discourse. It aims\nto understand how the identity of cloned animals, especially those like myself who have\nbecome public figures, intersects with ethics, food politics, and social perception.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe cloning of a sheep, once thought an agricultural feat, now poses questions far beyond\ngenetics. My existence\u2014Dolly, the first cloned mammal\u2014triggered debates around iden-\ntity, ethics, and sentience.\nSociology offers a lens to explore how society reacts to such\nbreakthroughs and the ripple effects in policy, food culture, and activism.\n2\nMethodology\n2.1\nSurvey Design and Distribution\nA mixed-methods approach was adopted:\n\u2022 Quantitative polling via leaflets distributed in farmer\u2019s markets and university quads\n(n = 1,000).\n\u2022 Qualitative interviews with 42 participants (farmers, scientists, and vegetarians).\n\u2022 Media content analysis of over 100 articles and op-eds from 1996\u20132001.\n1\n\n2.2\nPolling Questions Example\n\u2022 Q1: Do you believe cloning animals is ethically acceptable?\n\u2022 Q2: Are you aware that Dolly the Sheep was the first mammal cloned?\n\u2022 Q3: Would you eat meat from a cloned animal?\n3\nResults\n3.1\nPublic Opinion Polling\nTable 1: Summary of Polling Data (n = 1,000)\nQuestion\nYes (%)\nNo (%)\nUnsure (%)\nQ1: Ethical Cloning?\n34\n48\n18\nQ2: Heard of Dolly?\n89\n7\n4\nQ3: Eat Cloned Meat?\n22\n67\n11\n3.2\nMedia Sentiment Analysis\nSentiment was coded as positive, neutral, or negative toward cloning.\nFigure 1: Media Sentiment Over Time (1996\u20132001)\nFindings indicate a shift from scientific curiosity (1996\u201397) to ethical concern (1998\u201399),\nand finally a bifurcation into support for innovation vs.\ncritique of commodifying life\n(2000\u201301).\n2\n\n4\nDiscussion\n4.1\nSociological Themes Emerged\n1. Identity: Respondents frequently anthropomorphized me, referring to me not just as a\nscientific specimen, but as a \u201ccelebrity sheep.\u201d\n2. Fear of the Unknown: Cloning was often tied to fears of dehumanization, corporate\ncontrol of life, and \u201cplaying God.\u201d\n3.\nEthical Evolution: Younger demographics showed greater openness to animal\ncloning under ethical guidelines. Vegetarian participants were overwhelmingly against cloning\nif it supports meat consumption.\n4.2\nNotable Quotes\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my dinner to come with a Wikipedia page.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous Butcher,\nGlasgow\n\u201cShe\u2019s not just a sheep\u2014she\u2019s a statement.\u201d \u2014 Protestor, EWE March 2001\n5\nConclusion\nCloning is not merely a biological process\u2014it is a social flashpoint.

Griffin\nRoslin Institute (Edinburgh),  Roslin,  UK\nAbstract\n\u2018The Roslin Institute near Edinburgh is one of the world\u2019s leading centres for\nresearch on farm animals. Its main expertise is in animal genetics, with the\nresults benefiting the livestock breeding and production industries in\nparticular.  Its work was, however, little known to the general public. A single\nlamb  changed all that.  Dr Harry Griffin, Assistant Director at the Institute,\nexplains.....\u2019\nDolly  was the first mammal cloned from a cell from an adult animal.  She was derived from cells that had been\ntaken from the udder of a 6-year old Finn Dorset ewe and cultured for several weeks in the laboratory. Individual\ncells were then fused with unfertilised eggs from which the genetic material had been removed. Two hundred and\nseventy seven of these \u2018reconstructed eggs\u2019 - each now with a diploid nucleus from the adult animal - were\ncultured for  6 days in temporary recipients.  Twenty nine of the eggs that appeared to have developed normally\nto the blastocyst stage were implanted into surrogate Scottish Blackface ewes. One gave rise to  live lamb, Dolly,\n some 148 days later.\nDOLLYMANIA\nDolly was born on 5 July 1996. It took Ian Wilmut and his colleagues a few weeks to complete the experimental\nwork and several more months before they had written a paper and had it accepted by Nature. Publication was\nconfirmed for  27 February, 1997 and by then plans were well advanced to handle the expected media interest.\n We knew  that Nature was featuring Dolly in the weekly press release that it distributes each  Friday. The\ninformation in these releases is \u2018embargoed\u2019 until 7 o\u2019clock on the Wednesday evening before publication and\nthis is intended to provide journalists time to research their stories more carefully before going to press.  However,\n ideas of a relaxing weekend were shattered by  two phone calls late on Saturday  warning  us that the Observer\nwould be running the story the next day. \nA quick visit to the newsagents first thing on Sunday confirmed our story was on the front page.  The\nObserver\u2019s science writer Robin McKie  had resisted taking a sensational line but he had raised fears about\nhuman cloning.   Our main aim then was to ensure that the other papers have some solid facts to report.  Two of\nthe team at Roslin and four at our PR agency De facto\u2019s office in Basingstoke worked throughout the day to\nanswer  calls from  around the world and set up schedules for reporters,  TV crews and photographers desperate\nto visit Roslin.\nOn Monday,  Dolly provided a major story in most of the  papers and Roslin was besieged by  reporters\nand TV crews from all over the world.  ABC, NBC, CNN and CBS all beamed live interviews across the Atlantic\nvia satellite vans in the car park.  Phones rang incessantly and extra spokesmen were drafted in to help.  Dolly\nquickly became the most photographed sheep of all time  and was invited to appear on a chat show in the US.\nAstrologers asked  for her date of birth and the shares of our collaborators PPL  rose sharply.  President Bill\nClinton called on his bioethics commission to report on the ethical implications within 90 days and Ian Wilmut\nwas invited to testify to both the UK House of Commons and  the US Congress.  Dolly Parton said she was\n\u2018honoured\u2019 that we had called our sheep after her.\n\nIn the first week after the story broke, we estimated that together the Roslin Institute, PPL and De Facto\nanswered more than 2000 telephone calls,  talked at length to close on 100 reporters and provided access to Dolly\nto 16 film crews and more than 50 photographers from all over the world. After all this, the actual publication\nof the paper in Nature on Thursday 27 February seemed an anticlimax.   \n\u2018Science Breakthrough of the Year\u2019\nFor developmental biologists, Dolly\u2019s existence challenges one of the fundamental tenets of developmental\nbiology.

After\nall, even over a 90 year lifespan a liver remains a liver, a nerve cell a nerve cell.  The production of a live lamb\nfrom a cell taken from the udder of  a 6-year old ewe demonstrated that differentiated cells are not immutable:\nit was possible to take a differentiated cell and turn its biological clock back to zero. To start its life all over again.\n And for this, Dolly was voted \u2018Science Breakthrough of 1997\u2019  by the editors of the prestigious US journal\nScience, ahead of NASA\u2019s Pathfinder mission to Mars and advances in cyclotron design.\nAt first Dolly was a clone alone, but in recent months clones of adult mice have been reported from Hawaii and\ncloned calves from both New Zealand and Japan. These additional reports demonstrate that Dolly is not an\n\u2018anecdote\u2019 and that it should be possible to clone from a variety of different cell types and species.\nCloning of humans\nThe intense media interest was not with sheep.  The immediate assumption was that cloning of humans was just\naround the corner and that seemed to trigger an explosion (at least in the media) of  fears about the future. \nHowever, in contrast to the barrage of calls from the press, the relatively small size of our postbag suggested that\nthe general public was  much more sanguine.  They seemed to know that the scenarios that the media were\nimagining were unlikely to be realised and could, as a consequence, be enjoyed in safety. Just like \u2018the X  files\u2019.\nMuch of the media speculation was based on science fiction rather than good sense,  with the Times and\na Dr Patrick Dixon taking our  award for the most outrageous list of  \u2018reasons\u2019 for cloning humans.  A common\nmisunderstanding was that clones would be somehow less than human.   However, most of us have already met\na human clone - an identical twin - and no one would seriously suggest that we should produce twins to order as\nsources of spare parts. Others seemed to believe that cloning would produce an identical photocopy, rather than\na child that would grow up with a personality and behaviour all of its own.\nThose speculating about potential uses in humans need to recognise that the technology is very much in\nits infancy.  Our experiments in sheep produced several lambs with developmental abnormalities that died in late\npregnancy or soon after being born.  A clone will inherit somatic mutations from the donor and this in turn may\nlead to premature ageing or a higher incidence of cancer later in life.  These risks alone mean that it would be\ngrossly unethical to perform similar experiments in women now, however desperate they might be to have a child.\nExperience with cloning in farm animals may identify ways of reducing risk  but this is likely to take\nmany years.  In the meantime,  society as a whole has time to contemplate which uses of the technology might\nbe acceptable and which would not.  Views will inevitable change over time: the first test tube baby, Louise\nBrown, was born in 1979 and in vitro fertilisation is now commonplace.  Attitudes will also vary between\ncountries: many feared cloning would be exploited by megalomaniacs but in our view it is far more likely that\nthe ethical boundaries will be tested by the in vitro fertilisation clinics in the US or the Far East.\n\nNuclear transfer\nCloning by nuclear transfer is not itself novel.  The technique was first reported in frogs in 1953 and has been\nused widely since in amphibians to study early development.  This work showed that the first few cell divisions\nafter fertilisation produce cells that are totipotent (i.e. they can develop into all of the cell types that make up the\nwhole animal).  As the embryo develops further, the cells  lose this property and the success of nuclear transfer\nrapidly declines.

Some nuclear transfer experiments using cells from adult frogs produced viable embryos, but\nthese never developed beyond the tadpole stage.\nNuclear transfer in mammals proved to be more difficult. The cloning of mice using nuclei from very\nearly embryos was reported in 1977 but this work was not repeatable and interest among developmental\nbiologists waned.  Research on nuclear transfer in cattle continued, stimulated by the potentially large commercial\nbenefits of multiplying elite embryos.  Artificial insemination allows each bull to have thousands of offspring but\neach cow can only produce 5 or 6 calves in a lifetime.   Multiple ovulation embryo transfer (MOET) and cloning\nby embryo splitting have been used to partially redress this imbalance,  but these techniques have limited potential\nfor further development.  By contrast, nuclear transfer has, at least in principle, the ability to produce an unlimited\nnumber of identical animals.\nBy the middle of the 1980's several research groups from around the world had produced cloned sheep\nand cattle by transferring nuclei directly from early embryos.   In 1985 Steen Willesden in the US had produce\nlive calves  by nuclear transfer from embryos that had progressed to the 64- and 128-cell stage and this was the\nfirst suggestion that nuclear transfer in mammals  was possible from at least partially differentiated cells.\nIn the early 1980's the then Animal Breeding Research Organisation initiated a programme designed to\nproduce transgenic sheep and cattle that would secrete human proteins in their milk. Using the beta- lactoglobulin\npromoter, John Clark and colleagues were able to direct expression of the transgene to the mammary gland. This\nsuccess led to the setting up in 1987 of PPL Therapeutics and in 1989 the  production of  Tracy, a transgenic\nsheep that secreted 35 g of a human protein- alpha-1-antitrypsin- in her milk.  Over the same period other groups\nhad developed other transgenic livestock, including genetically modified pigs for use as sources of organs for\ntransplantation to human patients.\nAt this time the only way of producing transgenic livestock was by pro-nuclear injection.  This procedure\ninvolves the introduction of 200-300 copies of the transgene into a recently fertilised egg which is then implanted\nin a surrogate mother. Only 2-3% of eggs give rise to transgenic offspring and only a small proportion of these\nexpress the added gene at sufficiently high levels to be of commercial interest.  It was also only possible to add\ngenes.\nIf animals can be derived from cells in culture, then it is possible to carry out much more specific genetic\nmodifications, including the removal or substitution of specific genes.  This has been achieved in mice using\nembryo stem (ES) cells but to date no one has yet succeeded in obtaining ES cells from cattle, sheep or pigs. After\nlearning of Willesden\u2019s  success,  Ian Wilmut thought that nuclear transfer might provide an alternative.\nThe major  breakthrough came in 1995 when Keith Campbell, Ian Wilmut and colleagues  produced live\nlambs - Megan and Morag - by nuclear transfer from cells from early embryos that had been cultured for several\nmonths in the laboratory.   The key element in this success was the induction of quiescence in the donor cells.\nHowever, at this stage they did not know if they had also stumbled on a particular amenable cell type simply  by\nchance.\nAdditional experiments were performed to test if successful nuclear transfer technique was restricted to\n embryo-derived cells or could be carried out with a wider range of cell types.  Nuclear transfer was carried out\n\nfrom  embryo-derived cells, foetal fibroblasts and - in collaboration with PPL Therapeutics - cells from an adult\newe.  Four lambs were born from embryo cells, two from the foetal cells and one, subsequently named Dolly,\nfrom an adult cell.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7192, "end_char_idx": 11816, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "333ca566-d334-40bf-b9ca-b089d5943c9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "333ca566-d334-40bf-b9ca-b089d5943c9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "Dolly- The science behind the world's most famous sheep.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b3cb09f-ada6-42ce-9928-1db33782babc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "Dolly- The science behind the world's most famous sheep.pdf"}, "hash": "4f4bb04610366c1ff194b9e5ca820cba01229b997dd93907b4f078983e406c16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c42363d-9265-469b-a502-b9cab6aca2c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "Dolly- The science behind the world's most famous sheep.pdf"}, "hash": "e86c2ed9a47f811a2354e4bb1ee889b8661750e8e51b332697d793d80e25a3b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "591bef5b-f928-4ddc-b48c-a5a385c1bb62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15ca7cd3aee85c8add90e1afd63d198f8809e2f8c1ec6ed554fa60531350d8cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The major  breakthrough came in 1995 when Keith Campbell, Ian Wilmut and colleagues  produced live\nlambs - Megan and Morag - by nuclear transfer from cells from early embryos that had been cultured for several\nmonths in the laboratory.

Four lambs were born from embryo cells, two from the foetal cells and one, subsequently named Dolly,\nfrom an adult cell.  Their identity was confirmed by DNA testing and the results published in Nature on 27\nFebruary 1997.\nPractical applications of cloning\nThe ability (via nuclear transfer)  to derive live animals from cultured cells provides an alternative way of \nproducing  transgenic farm animals.  Moreover, the ability to manipulate many millions of cells at once opens\nup the possibility of much more specific genetic modifications,  including the deletion or substitution of specific\ngenes or the introduction of the single letter changes in the whole of the genetic code that are characteristic  of\nmany human genetic diseases.\nhuman therapeutic proteins\nHuman proteins are in great demand for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Whereas some can be purified from\nblood,  this is expensive and runs the risk of contamination by AIDS or hepatitis C.  Proteins can be produced\nin human cell culture but costs are very high and output small.  Much larger quantities can be produced in bacteria\nor yeast but the proteins produced can be difficult to purify and they lack the appropriate post-translational\nmodifications that are needed for efficacy in vivo.\nBy contrast, human proteins that have appropriate post-translational modifications can be produced in\n the milk of transgenic sheep, goats and cattle.  Output can be as high as 40 g per litre of milk and costs are\nrelatively low.  PPL Therapeutics, one of the leaders in this field, recently announced that alpha-1-antitrypsin\nproduced from a transgenic flock is now being used to treat cystic fibrosis patients in phase 2 clinical trials. In\nthe US, Genzyme Transgenics have focussed on goats and their lead product, tissue plasminogen activator, is also\nin clinical trials. \nAn immediate advantage of producing transgenic animals by nuclear transfer is  that it uses less than half\nof the  experimental animals than does pronuclear injection. It is also possible  to specify the sex of the offspring\nand thereby substantially reduce the time taken to generate a production flock. PPL and the Roslin Institute have\nalready used this approach to produce Polly and Molly, two transgenic sheep that secrete the human blood clotting\nfactor IX in their milk.\nAt present such transgenic animals produce a human protein in addition to the normal complement of\nmilk proteins. This restricts yield and with some proteins there would be a major advantage in removing one or\nmore of the endogenous milk proteins.  This is the case with serum albumin where the total demand for treatment\nof burns and other trauma is estimated at over 600 tonnes each year. In this case production would be in cattle\nand the aim would be to replace the bovine albumin gene with its human equivalent.\nnutraceuticals\nThere are a number of potential opportunities for altering the nutritional content of milk.  For example, cow\u2019s\nmilk is ideal for calves but not for premature infants.  Gene targeting using nuclear transfer will allow milk to be\nproduced in which one or more of the normal cow\u2019s proteins have been replaced by human proteins,  thereby\nimproving its nutritional quality for these special \u2018consumers\u2019.  Other people have a immune response to specific\nproteins in milk or are intolerant of lactose and gene targeting  would allow the creation of herds of cows that\nproduced milk lacking the problem  components.\nxenotransplantation\n\nOver the past 20 years transplantation of hearts and kidneys has become almost routine.  There is an  shortage\nof suitable organs for transplant (about 5000 each year in the UK) and many patients have to suffer prolonged\ndialysis and/or die as a result.

There is an  shortage\nof suitable organs for transplant (about 5000 each year in the UK) and many patients have to suffer prolonged\ndialysis and/or die as a result. Transgenic pigs are being developed as sources of organs to meet the shortfall.\n  The pigs produced so far have an added human protein such as compliment inhibitory factor that coats the pig\ntissues and is intended to prevent immediate rejection of the transplanted heart or kidney.\nThe ability to remove genes could have a major impact on the success of such xenotransplants. \nSurprisingly, most of the antibodies in our blood that would the react against a pig organs recognise a single\ncarbohydrate linkage, galactose alpha (1,3) galactose.  This sugar residue does not appear to be functionally\nimportant because it is not present in  humans and monkeys.  Elimination of the glycosyltransferase responsible\nfor attaching this sugar residue by targeting the relevant gene in pigs is therefore expected to greatly reduce\nhyperacute rejection of transplanted organs.\nanimal models of disease\nMice in which specific mutations have been deliberately introduced have often proved very useful as models for\nstudying  human genetic diseases.  In some cases, differences between mice and humans means that the effects\nof the introduced  mutation are not the same as in the human genetic disease.  This is the case for the cystic\nfibrosis mutation, where differences in chloride channel mean that the knock out experiment in mice has little\neffect on  lung physiology.\nNuclear transfer will extend the range of species in which gene targeting will be possible and thereby\nprovide better models to  test treatments for  human diseases.  Lung physiology in sheep and humans is very\nsimilar and the gene targeting to introduce the cystic fibrosis mutation in sheep would be expected to produce a\nsimilar phenotype in homozygous animals to that in man.  The deliberate creation of a genetic disease in a large\nanimal raise public concerns and the ethical justification of creation of such a model would need to be well argued.\ncell therapy\nIntact cells are already  used to treat patients suffering from a number of diseases, including leukemia and\nParkinson\u2019s disease.  In most cases these cells have to be obtained from close relatives to avoid problems of\nimmune rejection.\nThe fact that Dolly was cloned from a cell taken from an adult ewe shows that even differentiated cells\ncan be \u2018reprogrammed\u2019 into all the cell types that make up an intact animal. The only way that we can perform\nthis dedifferentiation step now  is by \u2018incubating\u2019 cells  in the cytoplasm of an unfertilised egg but when we know\nmore about the mechanisms involved, then it may be possible that human  cells can be reprogrammed without\nthe use of a human egg.  This would allow the patient\u2019s  own cells to be used in cell  therapies, thereby avoiding\nthe time, expensive and uncertainty  of  tissue matching.  Cells would removed from the patient, converted into\nthe desired cell type in the laboratory and then reintroduced into same patient for treatment. \ncloning in farm animal production\nIn addition to providing a route to gene targeting in livestock, nuclear transfer could  be used to deliver what is\nthe popular image of cloning:  that is the production of,  at least  in principle, unlimited numbers of genetically\nidentical animals.\nThere are major practical hurdles to overcome before this could be a routine procedure in livestock\n\nproduction.

At present this is achieved through\nartificial insemination - which supplies only half the genes- and by limited use of embryo transfer. This process\nis not that efficient and in dairy cattle, the performance of the average cow  is probably some 10 years behind\n the best.   With cloning, it would be possible to remove this difference.  Farmers who could afford it would\nreceive embryos that would be clones of the most productive cows of elite herds and thereby lift the performance\nof their herds to that of the very best within one generation.   This  would be a one-off gain, since from then on\nthe rate of genetic progress would return to that of the elite herds.\nIn this scenario, breeding companies would sell cloned embryos in much the same way as they now sell\nsemen.  Farmers would choose cloned embryos for high merit beef bulls or dairy cows from catalogues that\ndescribed the genetic merit for a series of economically important traits, including fertility, health and longevity.\n The cloned embryo would be delivered to the farm much in the same way as semen straws are today, perhaps\nfrom breeders overseas.\nA major risk would be loss of genetic diversity but this could be avoided by systems that ensured that\nbreeding companies produced a limited number of clones of each genotype and restricted the number of each of\nthe clones that could be sold to any one producer.   Although the herds of some producers might consist entirely\nof cloned animals, the fact that they were clones of different elite animals may actually increase genetic diversity\non some farms. \ngenetic conservation\nAlthough cloning is associated in most people\u2019s minds with a loss of genetic diversity,  the techniques that were\nused to produce Dolly will also provide new approaches to genetic conservation.   With increasing commercial\npressures, many indigenous breeds  adapted to local conditions are under threat from imported  breeds that are\nbeing reared in intensive farming systems.  The local breeds may contain valuable genes that confer heat tolerance\nor disease resistance and there is an urgent need to prevent their extinction.  Current methods of conservation\ninvolve storage of frozen semen or embryos but are time consuming and  costly. As a consequence, the future of\nonly a small proportion of endangered breeds is being addressed.\nThe new techniques developed at Roslin may  provide much simpler and  more effective means of\nconserving breeds.   Blood samples, skin biopsies or even hair follicles might be suitable sources of cells that\ncould be grown briefly in the laboratory and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for long term storage or transfer to\nother endangered populations.\nTo some these applications seem much less glamorous than the prospect of the cloning of human\nbeings. In reality, they have the potential to provide radical new treatments for a wide variety of serious\ndiseases that affect many millions of people world-wide.  By contrast, the cloning of human beings- if and\nwhen it happens- is likely to remain a marginal activity with little impact on society beyond the immediate\nparticipants.\nFurther information on cloning, including references to work cited, is  available on the Institute\u2019s web site on\n\nwww.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18647, "end_char_idx": 22649, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c6545b1-c57f-4d45-bcb5-21443561a91e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c6545b1-c57f-4d45-bcb5-21443561a91e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "Dollly_Geneology.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc4dd0c9-74e9-4ade-91e7-7416ed994b11", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "Dollly_Geneology.pdf"}, "hash": "776bd92b81ea01c5d9cc99acc748ce291fe22facce8165b146e69ecc77d975ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DOLLY THE SHEEP\nGenealogy Report\nAs of June 2025\nFamily Tree Overview\nGrandparents\nMa Sheepington (Maternal)\nPa Lambsworth (Paternal)\nBorn: 1990, Scotland\u2019s Borders\nBorn: 1988, Scottish Highlands\n\u2193\nParents\nMum Sheepington (DNA Dornor)\nDad Lambsworth (Original DNA donor)\nCloned in 1996\nCloned in 1996\n\u2193\nDolly\nDolly the Sheep\nDr. Raymond the Ram\nBorn July 5,1996\nHusband\nDolly the Sheep\nBorn July 5, 1996, Scotland\nWorld\u2019s first cloned mammal\n\u2193\nOffspring (6 lambkins)\nBonnie\nSally\nBenny\nRosie\nBilly\nLuna\n\u2193\nGrandchildren (5 fluffy wonders)\nFluffy1 (b. 2023), Fluffy2 (b. 2024), Fluffy3 (b. 2024),\nFluffy4 (b. 2025), Fluffy5 (b. 2025)\n1\n\nSpecial Notes\n\u2022 Dolly\u2019s lineage includes some of the fluffiest and most activist sheep in all of Scot-\nland.\n\u2022 Genetic testing confirms no \u201csheep\u201dish secrets \u2014 just pure, proud ovine heritage.\n\u2022 Dolly\u2019s kids and grandkids carry on her passion for peaceful protest and good graz-\ning.\nPersonalized Sheep Message\n\u201cKeep baa-lieving in yourself and your woolly family!\u201d\n2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1002, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"5d5f739e-a43c-472c-8f9e-09e676d532e7": {"node_ids": ["66443e4f-f1a8-4a5e-9da9-215ddb9d018e"], "metadata": {"filename": "Dolly_Hawaiian_Baacation.txt"}}, "fdbb0dda-872e-4938-acf0-13027b033b3f": {"node_ids": ["9c70391c-bf3a-42b4-ace2-781d807a433d", "db0e8340-d40e-490e-b867-60ef0cbce3a3"], "metadata": {"filename": "Honey_Moon_Journal.txt"}}, "931006f3-1d34-43a0-a018-d7f601bb785f": {"node_ids": ["36d868aa-6af6-4886-8604-f891229f736d"], "metadata": {"filename": "Baa_I_Am_Dolly.txt"}}, "172b7a2e-dcd4-4d7c-ae53-93e9c2d8c131": {"node_ids": ["a33ec311-894b-4136-a861-76e794df5023"], "metadata": {"filename": "Dolly_Pottery_Interview.txt"}}, "48a9438c-7683-4714-b8f9-3c0a23bbef37": {"node_ids": ["fd306fc3-4f6f-446c-a16c-fa1e99e256e6"], "metadata": {"filename": "wedding_vows_to_my_ray_ray.txt"}}, "f538292d-b711-41f6-8d66-80941c715dff": {"node_ids": ["b96f5e66-a576-4fdc-8a5a-d72e5f373e49"], "metadata": {"filename": "Dollly_Thesis.pdf"}}, "8d551bdd-de42-4154-b8ae-123e8e11c72a": {"node_ids": ["e77dc948-27af-4988-992e-104026f23da5"], "metadata": {"filename": "The_New_Porker_Article.pdf"}}, "6b3cb09f-ada6-42ce-9928-1db33782babc": {"node_ids": ["4c00788d-307c-4c24-8067-c8db0a3817bb", "171cf881-da0c-4ab1-9dc9-d519b3ea5e70", "8c42363d-9265-469b-a502-b9cab6aca2c6", "333ca566-d334-40bf-b9ca-b089d5943c9e", "591bef5b-f928-4ddc-b48c-a5a385c1bb62", "e84f7c13-4cb9-410d-9e57-7862ada5ef9b"], "metadata": {"filename": "Dolly- The science behind the world's most famous sheep.pdf"}}, "fc4dd0c9-74e9-4ade-91e7-7416ed994b11": {"node_ids": ["5c6545b1-c57f-4d45-bcb5-21443561a91e"], "metadata": {"filename": "Dollly_Geneology.pdf"}}}}
